    "After the DoWhy Package's brief presentation on the previous notebook, this one's purpose will be to demonstrate its possibilities on a real-world data scenario in which causal inference methods were useful and proved their value as valuable tools in order to better comprehend interpret reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The case chosen was the classical Lalonde, specifically the data from a [posterior paper](https://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/papers/matching.pdf) about the same subject, whose idea was exactly to show how causal inference methods were able to reach similar results like the ones observed during a randomized experimental design by using observational data combined to the treated subjects (i.e successfully emulating a target trial).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The study will be divided into 3 main sections:\n",
    "- Project Setup: data and dependencies loading, along with the main parameters setting\n",
    "- Data Analysis: a brief data presentation to give a better sense of how the data look like\n",
    "- Causal Study: the causal inference implementation on both experimental and observational data\n",

On the sequence, the classical example conducted by Lalonde, to demonstrate how using classical OLS regressions on observational data might be inefficient to achieve reasonable estimates (however in a simpler form), is executed for similar purposes. Lastly, some of the simplest Causal Estimators available at Do Why are used aiming to reach a similar conclusion as to the paper's one: it's possible to execute satisfactory causal inference using observational data by applying robust methodology and application."
